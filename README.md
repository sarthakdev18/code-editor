# code-editor

A simple live code editor made using Html, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project was inspired by CodePen, a very famous online code editor on the internet that allows frontend developers to write their scripts independently and test them out.
This project allows you to write Html, CSS and JavaScript on the left window while simultaneously executing the output on the right window.
